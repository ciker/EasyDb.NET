ABOUT

EasyDb.NET is a .NET library for simplifying interaction with
various databases. Main features include:
1. Small and easy to use. Helps get rid of the repeating
   trivia such as opening and closing connections to simplify
   the development.
2. Cross-database. Provides db-irrelevant interfaces. To use
   a custom db, find the driver library and set a single-line
   configuration, then the EasyDb is ready to work.
3. Multi-databases manipulation support (master/slave mode).
   Operations can be perform on both master and slave db(s).
